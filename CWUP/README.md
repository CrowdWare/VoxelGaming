# CWUP – CrowdWare Unified Process

## What is CWUP?

CWUP (CrowdWare Unified Process) is a **user-centered, architecture-aware development process**
designed for **SoloDevs, small teams, and creator-driven systems**.

It combines proven ideas from:

- **RUP** (discipline, architecture, requirements)
- **AUP** (agility, iteration, risk-driven work)
- **Scrum** (backlog, increments, flow)
- **User Centered Design (HCI)**
- **Crowd participation**
- **AI / SI as a temporary team member**

CWUP is not a new heavyweight framework.
It is a **clear naming of an already working practice**:
building systems where **code, content, users, and feedback grow together**.

## Core Idea

> **Users are not just consumers.  
They participate in validation, creation, and prioritization –  
while architectural responsibility stays clear.**

CWUP is **user-centered, not user-driven**.

---

## Key Principles

- **Architecture first**  
  Systems must remain coherent while evolving.

- **Requirements live in the backlog**  
  Functional and non-functional requirements are visible, movable, and explicit.

- **Risk-driven development**  
  The most uncertain parts are validated first.

- **Early and continuous publishing**  
  Books, tools, and code are released early and refined iteratively.

- **Crowd as signal, not authority**  
  Users submit and rate feature requests; decisions remain with the architect.

- **Creation over consumption**  
  Users can become creators (e.g. Dungeon Builders), not just players.

- **No dark patterns, no hype**  
  Transparency, fairness, and autonomy are non-negotiable constraints.

## Roles in CWUP

CWUP focuses on **roles, not job titles**:

- **System Architect** – holds vision and decisions
- **Implementer** – code, tools, integration (human + AI)
- **Interaction / Game Designer** – mechanics, flow, usability
- **Creators** – build content using provided tools
- **Players / Users** – validate systems through real use
- **Crowd** – provides feedback and feature ratings

Large AAA roles like cinematics teams, celebrity marketing,
or content factories are **intentionally excluded**.

## When to Use CWUP

CWUP works especially well for:

- Indie games (MMO / RPG / Sandbox)
- Tooling platforms
- No-Code / Low-Code systems
- Knowledge-driven products (books + code)
- Long-living systems that evolve with their users

---

## What CWUP is NOT

- Not a voting democracy
- Not a marketing funnel
- Not a replacement for thinking
- Not a framework you must “adopt”

CWUP is a **working mindset**, documented.

## Short Definition

> **CWUP is a Unified Process for systems that grow with their users.**
