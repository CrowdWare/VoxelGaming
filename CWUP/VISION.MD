# RAID Simulator

No Grind. Just Raids.

⸻
## What It’s About

RAID Simulator is a cooperative-focused raid game about presence, healing, and insight.

There is no grind, no power spiral, and no race for numbers.
The game focuses exclusively on raids — understood as shared processes of resolving blockages rather than defeating enemies.

⸻

## What Does Not Exist
	•	no level grind
	•	no ego-based progression
	•	no cosmetic status symbols

⸻

A raid does not end with the death of a boss,
but with exhaustion.

⸻

## Roles (Short)
	•	Tank holds presence
	•	Damage dealers open chakras
	•	Healers stabilize consciousness

Not faster.
Not stronger.
More coherent.

⸻

## Guiding Principle

You don’t become better by doing more.
You become better by becoming more aware.

⸻

## What Is RAID Simulator? (Classic MMO Context)

RAID Simulator is a single-player, PvE-focused raid simulation game designed for experienced MMO players.

It removes everything around raiding that consumes time without adding gameplay value:
	•	no leveling
	•	no grinding
	•	no world travel
	•	no loot drama

Instead, the game begins exactly where raids begin.

You command and play an entire raid group, switch perspectives freely, and directly control any character you own — tank, healer, or damage dealer — while the remaining raid members are driven by AI and scripts.

⸻

## Core Idea

Experience is progression — not time.

If you bring years of MMO knowledge, RAID Simulator lets you use it immediately:
	•	develop tank control without DPS aggro chaos
	•	refine caster rotations and burst windows
	•	manage healer stress situations and raid damage waves
	•	design and execute raid strategies without organizing 40 people

⸻

## Key Features (v1.0)
	•	Single-player PvE
	•	5-player dungeons and 10-player raids
	•	Multiple raid encounters with real mechanics
(tank swaps, coordination checks, healer pressure)
	•	Perspective switching between raid members
	•	Direct control of owned characters with action bars and cooldowns
	•	AI-driven raid members with predictable, scriptable behavior
	•	Training dummies for tanking, healing, and rotation testing
	•	Clear, information-driven UI inspired by classic MMO raid design

⸻

## Classes & Roles

RAID Simulator uses classic raid archetypes inspired by established MMO design:
	•	Warrior (Protection, Fury) — single-target threat and damage
	•	Paladin (Holy, Protection) — AoE threat and utility
	•	Mage (Elemental, Arcane) — sustained damage and burst windows
	•	Warlock (Affliction, Destruction) — DoT management and burst
	•	Hunter (Marksman, Survival) — ranged damage and mobility
	•	Priest (Holy, Discipline) — throughput healing and mitigation
	•	Druid (Restoration, Bear) — HoTs and caster-boss tanking

Rotations and mechanics are inspired by proven raid designs
(e.g. Wrath-era gameplay), reinterpreted for clarity and simulation.

⸻

## Design Philosophy
	•	Clarity over spectacle
	•	Decisions over APM
	•	Simulation over progression treadmills
	•	User-centered design

Version 1.0 is designed by an experienced MMO player acting as the initial user.
From the first public release onward, the game evolves through real player feedback — treated as design input, not automatic requirements.

⸻

## Why Single Player?

RAID Simulator launches as a single-player experience by design.

This enables:
	•	focused raid mechanics
	•	deterministic simulations
	•	no networking complexity
	•	faster iteration and cleaner design

If a strong community forms and sufficient resources become available, future expansions (multiplayer, PvP, larger worlds, or even 3D) may be explored — without promises or overreach.

⸻

## Platforms
	•	Desktop (Windows / macOS / Linux)
	•	Keyboard & mouse
	•	Distributed via Steam

⸻

## No Loot — Only Gifts

Bosses in RAID Simulator do not drop loot.

They offer gifts.

Gifts are not rewards for damage or performance.
They are acknowledgements of completed openings.

⸻

## What a Gift Is

A gift represents:
	•	integration
	•	insight
	•	a shared moment of coherence

Gifts are given after an encounter resolves —
not because the boss was defeated,
but because nothing remained closed.

⸻

## What Gifts Are Not
	•	no random drops
	•	no gear upgrades
	•	no power escalation
	•	no competitive distribution

There is no rolling.
There is no scarcity drama.

⸻

## Types of Gifts

Gifts may include:
	•	access to a new practice or ability refinement
	•	a reduction of resistance in future encounters
	•	narrative closure or transformation
	•	a subtle, permanent harmonization effect

Gifts affect how you play, not how strong you are.

⸻

## When Gifts Are Given
	•	If all required chakras were opened → gifts are shared
	•	If openings were incomplete → no gifts are given

This is not a punishment.
It is a reflection.

⸻

## Design Principle

A gift cannot be taken.
It can only be received.

Bosses do not lose something.
They let something go.

⸻

## Summary
	•	No loot tables
	•	No gear progression
	•	No RNG rewards
	•	Gifts replace drops

RAID Simulator removes extraction-based rewards
and replaces them with meaningful acknowledgment.

⸻

## Rank Progression (After Completion)

After all abilities are unlocked:
	•	no new abilities are added
	•	progression continues by increasing ability ranks

Rank progression:
	•	abilities remain at Rank 1 initially
	•	during subsequent cycles, the ability of the current chakra is improved to Rank 2, then Rank 3, and so on

Higher ranks do not increase power numerically.
They provide:
	•	earlier activation
	•	smoother execution
	•	greater stability
	•	fewer errors under pressure

⸻

## Endgame

True endgame begins after 7 full cycles.

At this point:
	•	all chakras are fully developed
	•	all abilities are unlocked and refined
	•	no content is locked behind power progression

Endgame play focuses on:
	•	mastery
	•	clarity
	•	coordination
	•	speedruns and record attempts

Speedruns test composure and coherence, not damage output.

⸻

## Design Principle

Progression is not about becoming stronger.
It is about becoming more stable.

RAID Simulator rewards awareness, timing, and responsibility —
not repetition or accumulation.

⸻

## Presence Instead of Taunt

RAID Simulator does not use taunts, threat tables, or aggro mechanics.

There is no “abspotten”.

Instead, encounters are based on conscious position exchange.

⸻

## How It Works

Bosses do not fixate on players.
They focus on places of presence within the encounter space.

A player who stands in such a position and maintains calm, grounded presence will carry the pressure of the encounter.

When this presence becomes unstable, another player may step forward and take the position.

There is:
	•	no forced targeting
	•	no provocation mechanics
	•	no instant switches

Only a deliberate exchange of responsibility.

⸻

## Sharing the Pressure

Bosses apply pressure through:
	•	lies
	•	projections
	•	verbal attacks
	•	destabilizing behavior

This pressure is not meant to be endured indefinitely by one player.

Instead:
	•	responsibility is shared
	•	presence rotates
	•	no one is expected to carry everything

Progress depends on knowing when to step in
and when to step back.

⸻

## Why This Exists

Traditional tanking often leads to:
	•	role scarcity
	•	burnout
	•	blame concentration
	•	heroic overidentification

RAID Simulator replaces this with:
	•	distributed responsibility
	•	awareness-based role shifts
	•	collective resilience

There is no tank shortage, because tanking is not a role —
it is a temporary state of presence.

⸻

## Design Principle

You do not hold until you collapse.
You hold until someone else is ready.

This system:
	•	removes aggro management
	•	eliminates taunt mechanics
	•	prevents single-player overload
	•	reinforces cooperation through awareness

Presence is shared.
Pressure moves.
The group remains intact.

## GameEngine

We are testing or ideas with Godot and Unreal Engine.
Because of the fact that we already switched to use Vulkan/C++ directly instead of Godot for the RaidBuilder, it might me possible that we prefer to use our own game engine. 

## Status

RAID Simulator is under active development.

Early releases focus on:
	•	core gameplay systems
	•	raid design
	•	UI clarity

If you’re looking for:
	•	immediate access to raid gameplay
	•	a place to test strategies and rotations
	•	a raid experience that respects your time

Welcome.
